Formerly, corpse was a try to create a TDS RPG game in the post-apocalyptic genre called as *the Corpse Inc*. For now, corpse is just raw useless game engine, which's planned to be rewritten in Rust sometime. Corpse's corpsed.

A team-making of the own game engine on top of pygame, esper and tiled was an amazing experience, which showed us that gamedev sucks. Thank Yandex Lyceum for making us trying so.
